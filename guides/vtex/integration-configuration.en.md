# Integration configuration 

To offer Mercado Pago payment solutions in VTEX stores, you need to configure your integration. To do so, follow the steps below: 

1. [Create a MercadoPagoV2 gateway affiliation](/developers/en/docs/vtex/integration/create-gateway-affiliation-v2). 
2. If you already have a MercadoPagoV1 gateway affiliation, [migrate to MercadoPagoV2](/developers/en/docs/vtex/integration/v1-v2-migration). 
3. [Configure Device Fingerprint](/developers/en/docs/vtex/integration/configure-device-fingerprint). 
4. Additionally, check our [possible integration errors](/developers/en/docs/vtex/integration/possible-errors) page.
