# Configure payments Checkout Pro
 
With [Checkout Pro](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/landing), the buyer will be directed from the store to the Mercado Pago website where he must fill in the requested information and make the payment. This way, the transaction is processed and completed outside your store environment. It is not necessary for the buyer to have a Mercado Pago account and, at the end of the transaction, the buyer can be returned to your store.
 
To integrate Checkout Pro, follow the steps below.
 
. In the Administrative Panel of your store on Tiendanube, access **Settings > Payment Methods**.
2. Locate the Mercado Pago plugin in the list of payment methods and click on **Edit**.
3. Select your store's **country of operation** and **currency**.
4. In the "Type of integration" field, change it to **Purchase process on the Mercado Pago website**.
5. Choose the payment methods you want to offer in the Mercado Pago payment environment, which can be:
  ----[mlb]----
  * **Credit card**.
  * **Bank slip (or Mercado Pago account balance)**.
  * **Pix**. The Pix payment option will only be displayed if there is a Pix key registered with Mercado Pago. If you haven't created it yet, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60tApKYVnkA) and see the step by step.
