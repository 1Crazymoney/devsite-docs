# Types of integration

It is possible to use Point in two ways:

* **Without integration:** In this model, the seller manually enters the payment data and then inserts the buyer's card in the Point machine. After these steps, the seller will follow the next steps based on the instructions displayed in the Mercado Pago app. To offer Point payments without the need of an integration, see the section [How to use Point without integration](/developers/en/docs/mp-point/how-tos/how-to-use-point-without-integration). 
<br><br>
* **Integrated:** In this model, the seller has 4 different types of integration that will vary according to the business needs and technical knowledge of the integrator. See the table below for details on each type of integration available and choose the most appropriate one for your business model.

| Integration type | Description | Devices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deep linking | Deep linking is a form of integration that takes place from a link generated by Mercado Pago that includes all billing data (buyer name/amount/payment methods). Once this link is called, the buyer is redirected to a Mercado Pago page to enter payment details and complete the transaction. See the section [Integrate via Deep linking](/developers/en/docs/mp-point/integration-configuration/integrate-mobile-devices/integrate-via-deep-linking) for more information. | Point Mini |
| Via API | In this method, the entire integration process is performed through the Point APIs. See [Integrate via API](/developers/en/docs/mp-point/integration-configuration/integrate-mobile-devices/integrate-via-api) for more information. | Point Mini |
| API for POS | The Point integrations API allows you to connect your points of sale (POS) to the Point ecosystem to receive payments on pre-configured terminals, ensuring a unified payment experience. See [Integrate with POS](/developers/en/docs/mp-point/integration-configuration/integrate-with-pdv/introduction) for more information. | Point Plus |
