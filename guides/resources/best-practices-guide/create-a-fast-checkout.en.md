# Create a fast checkout

To make the payment process easy and fast for your users, your checkout must be easy to navigate and understand.

We recommend building a multi-step experience where each step focuses on a different action, especially when it comes to experience in mobile devices. This way, users can focus their attention and it is easier for them to find what they are looking for without having to scroll too much.

For mobile, use short steps which drag attention and are easy to navigate. In turn, for desktop, you can use one step experiences, since users have more control over their actions and it is easier to find what they are looking for.

## Scannability

**Scannability** helps to visually navigate the screen and understand the different sections and steps of the page. There are elements you can add to provide scannability and context for the user: 

### Progress indicator

It is a **progress bar** that indicates to users in which step they are. You can segment them in equal parts, indicating each step of the checkout. This way users can visualize the step they are and how long it will take to complete the payment process.

Place a segmented bar to represent analogous units.

### Headings and subheadings

**Headings** are indispensable for scannability since they are the first thing users see and, most of the time, it is the only element they read when they scroll through the screen. Like **subheadings**, they help to segment the content and give information about what to do. Write them clearly and concisely so that they are easy to read and highlight them with a larger or bold font.

Always respect the verb tenses and the grammatical person you use in your texts so as not to generate inconsistencies and confuse the users.

### Bullets and highlights

**Bullets** are a dotted list of different items and **highlights** are underlined or highlighted texts. Use bullets to make lists to help users read information faster and highlights to emphasize key words or important sentences that add value and make the page easier to scan.

Use bullets and highlights to order information visually and make reading easier. Remember that reading a list requires less effort than reading a paragraph.

## Consistency 

**Consistency** is a key aspect to provide coherence. If all the components or content of your checkout followed a different logic, users would not know how to act on them at each step. Consistency helps to establish patterns that users understand and remember. Try to be consistent both visually and textually.
