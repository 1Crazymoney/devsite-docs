> PRODUCT: REPORTS

We have expanded the customization options in the Releases and All Transactions reports.

With the new configurable feature report_translation, it is possible to change the default language of the column headers, so that you can view them in your preferred language.

This feature is disabled by default but you can enable it by selecting the option "Report Language", in the [Settings](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/balance/reports/settlement/settings) screen. Once you do that, we recommend that you verify if the integrations based on Excel files (.xlsx), that allow automatic reconciliation, work correctly.

If after enabling this feature your integration does not work properly, update it based on the new headers.

Go to [All Transactions](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/manage-account/reports/account-money/api#bookmark_configurable_attributes) and [Releases](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/manage-account/reports/released-money/api#bookmark_configurable_attributes) report documentation.
