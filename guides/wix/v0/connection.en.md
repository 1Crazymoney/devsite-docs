Connecting and configuring Mercado Pago as a payment method in your Wix store can be done in two simple and quick steps. In the first one, you connect Mercado Pago as a payment method in your Wix store, and in the second one, you configure the connector with your production credentials.

## Connect Mercado Pago

To connect with Mercado Pago as a provider in your Wix store, follow the steps below.

1. Go to **Accept Payments** in your site's dashboard.
2. Click the **Connect** button next to "MercadoPago".


## Configure the means of payment

To finish configuring Mercado Pago as a means of payment, follow the steps below.

1. On the configuration page, fill in the fields with your [production credentials](https://www.mercadopago.com/settings/account/credentials) (note that the credentials requested by Wix are Public Key and Access Token) and confirm the connection.

And that's it! Your integration is set up and you are already offering Mercado Pago as a payment method in your store.
