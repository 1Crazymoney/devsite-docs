# Payment Processing

Integrating Redelcom devices via API allows you to process payments based on requests generated by your own software, which enables RDCPass to collect and deliver the transaction results.

The necessary operations to start processing payments via API are:
1. [Get Terminal](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/api-integration/payments-processing/get-terminal).
2. [Create a payment intent](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/api-integration/payments-processing/create-payment-intent).

In addition, API integration will allow you to:
- [Query previously created payment intents](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/api-integration/payments-processing/query-payment-intent).
- [Print receipts](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/api-integration/print-receipts), whether they are Documentos Tributarios Electr√≥nicos (DTE) or other types of documents.
