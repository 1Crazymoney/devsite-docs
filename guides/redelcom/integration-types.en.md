# Types of integration

You can choose from 2 different types of integration, which will vary based on the business's needs and the technical knowledge of the integrator. 

Please refer to the following table for details on each available integration type and select the one that best suits your business model.

| Integration Type  | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Local Integration  | Uses the POS (device) with the integratorâ€™s own Android app (APK). The user provides the necessary data for generating receipts, and the POS takes care of producing them. |
| API Integration   | Utilizes the POS (device) through a custom system (CRM, ERP) that sends requests via its software using the API. RDCPass manages and delivers the results. The POS can print receipts, or all the data can be sent for the user's system to generate them. |
