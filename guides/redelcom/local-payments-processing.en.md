# Payment processing

The local integration of Redelcom devices allows you to process payments by adding intent-filters to the project you are integrating with.

Each intent-filter corresponds to a different intention, which means one of the operations allowed by the local integration:

* [Create a payment intention](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/payments-processing/create-payment-intent).
* [Search a previously created payment](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/payments-processing/payment-query).
* [Print a Documento Tributario Electr√≥nico (DTE)](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/payments-processing/dte-printing).
* [Query multiservice parameters](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/payments-processing/query-multiservice-parameters).
* [Load money in POS](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/payments-processing/load-money-in-pos).
* [Query and pay bills](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/payments-processing/query-and-pay-bills).
* [Pay telecommunications recharges](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/payments-processing/pay-telecommunications).
* [Print receipts](/developers/en/docs/redelcom/local-integration/android/printing-receipts).
