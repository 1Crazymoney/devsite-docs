# Android Integration

You can start using Redelcom by installing your **Android application (APK)** on the Redelcom device via USB.

Your app will communicate with the RDCPass system locally, allowing you to process payments, perform telecommunications recharges or bill payments, and even have the option to print Documentos Tributarios Electr√≥nicos or receipts directly from the Redelcom device.

You can see how the local integration with Redelcom works in the diagram below.
