# Mercado Pago with Checkout Pro

With Checkout Pro, the buyer will be directed from the store to the Mercado Pago website, where they must complete the requested information and make the payment. In this way, the transaction is processed and completed outside of the store environment. 

It is not necessary for the buyer to have a Mercado Pago account, **but we recommend encouraging the login to a Mercado Pago account to facilitate the entire purchase process**. At the end of the transaction, the buyer can be returned to the store.
