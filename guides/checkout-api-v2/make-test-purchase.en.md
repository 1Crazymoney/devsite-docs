# Make test purchase

Before making a test purchase, it is important to configure the **Production Public Key of your test buyer user** on the application frontend, in addition to the **production Access Token of your salesperson test user** on the backend.

> To test the integration, it is important that you use another browser or log out of your Mercado Pago account, as the buyer data must be different from the seller data.

With the credentials configured, follow the steps below to make the test purchase.


1. Start the integration configured with the **Seller test user credentials**.
2. Enter the buyer test user email.
3. Confirm the purchase.

Done! Once these steps are finished, the integration will be complete and you will be able to use your production credentials to use the Checkout API. For more information, see the section [Requirements to go to production](/developers/en/docs/checkout-api/integration-test/go-to-production-requirements)
