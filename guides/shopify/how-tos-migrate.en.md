# How to migrate to the new version of the Mercado Pago plugin

Find out how to migrate to the current version of the Mercado Pago plugin for Shopify.

1. Go to your [Shopify](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login) store.
2. In the store's administrative panel, click on **Settings**.
3. Once there, select the **Payments** option. 
4. In **Additional payment methods**, click on the **Add payment methods** option.
5. Click on the **Search by supplier** tab, then type "Checkout Mercado Pago" in the search bar. Once you find it, click on the **available** option.
6. Enter your **production credentials** (`public key` and `access token`) in the fields that require them. Remember to keep your [credentials](/developers/en/docs/shopify/additional-content/credentials) handy.
7. In the next step, you will be able to select the images of the payment methods you want to display in the store. **Important: these images are for illustrative purposes only and do not imply the activation of the payment method selected**.
8. Lastly, the store will offer you the option to **Enable test mode**. By activating this option, orders completed with Checkout Pro **will not be real orders**. That is, they will be test orders that, even if completed, will not have their status updated on the platform and will not appear on the Mercado Pago panel in the seller's account.
9. To finish, click on **Activate Mercado Pago**.
