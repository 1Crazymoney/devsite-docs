# Make a test

The test purchases ensure that payments are processed correctly before allowing actual sales. Follow the steps below to make a test purchase:

1. Go to the store's home page and **select a product to purchase**.
2. Click on **Buy**, and continue with your cart.
3. Enter the purchase information requested with an e-mail, address, and a valid zip code according to the country where the store operates, to simulate the shipping. Click on **Continue **.
4. Complete the required fields and select one of the payment method options you enabled for Checkout Transparente, such as credit or debit card, boleto, or Pix. To simulate a payment with a card, you can use our [test cards](/docs/shopify/integration-test/test-cards).
5. Click on **Pay**.
6. If the test runs without errors, it means that the installation of Checkout Transparente was successful and the store is ready to sell.
