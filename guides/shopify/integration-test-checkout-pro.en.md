# Make a test

The test purchases ensure that payments are processed correctly before allowing actual sales. Follow the steps below to make a test purchase:

1. Go to the store's home page and **select a product to purchase**.
2. Click on **Buy**, and continue with your cart.
3. Enter a valid zip code according to the country where the store operates, to simulate the shipping. Click on **Continue**.
4. Complete the requested fields, and select **Mercado Pago as a payment method**.
5. Click on **Pay**.
6. If the test runs without errors, and you are redirected to Mercado Pagoâ€™s checkout, it means that the installation of Checkout Transparente was successful, and the store is ready to sell.
