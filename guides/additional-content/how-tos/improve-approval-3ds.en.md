# 3DS 2.0

3DS 2.0 (**3-D Secure Authentication 2.0**) is a technology that allows the authentication of transactions with credit and debit cards in e-commerces, that is, it allows validating that the person making the purchase is really the holder of the card or have access to the cardholder's accounts to complete the payment.

An authenticated transaction has several benefits, including a higher probability of approval, avoiding chargeback losses for the seller, lower risk of fraud for the buyer, among others.
