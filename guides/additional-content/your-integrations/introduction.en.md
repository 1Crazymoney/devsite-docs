# Your integrations

Your Integrations is your integration management environment automatically created with a user ID (the Mercado Pago ID) when you open an account on Mercado Pago. In it, you can create a new application in the [Developer Dashboard](/developers/panel/app) or access the **Application Details** page for each listed application, as well as request access to credentials for an application you don't manage.


## Application details

The **Application Details** page consists of different sections, each with a different purpose.
* **General Information**: displays general information about the application.
* **Testing**: test the integration's functionality, perform tests, and simulate different transactions with **Credentials**, **Test Accounts**, and **Test Cards**.
* **Notifications**: configure the application to receive notifications for transaction-related events, such as payment alerts, fraud notifications, disputes, etc. There are two types of notifications available for configuration:
  1. **IPN**
  2. **Webhooks**
* **Production**: activate **Production Credentials** to start receiving payments in your online store and other applications.
