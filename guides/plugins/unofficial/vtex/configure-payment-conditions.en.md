# Configure payment conditions

**Payment conditions** are the payment methods that are displayed on the website for the checkout. They allow the configuration of fees, interests, special conditions, etc.

After you have created your affiliation with **MercadoPagoV2**, you must configure the **payment conditions** that will be offered to buyers.

The configuration of the payment conditions is carried out in the administration portal of the VTEX platform in the **Payment conditions** tab of the **Settings** menu within the **Payments** module.

## Checkout Mercado Pago configuration

Configure this solution to charge through **Mercado Pago**, using all the payment methods available on the platform.

If you configure **MercadoPagoPro**, the buyer will pay in the Mercado Pago environment through the modal web form directly in your store.

If you configure **MercadoPagoWallet**, the buyer completes the payment with the Mercado Pago wallet exclusively for registered users, and once the process is finished, they will return to your store.

This is configured following the same steps shown above, common to other payment conditions.
