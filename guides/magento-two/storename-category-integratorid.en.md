# Store Name, Category and Integrator ID

In this configuration step, it is necessary to enter store information and, optionally, the `integrator_id`, which allows monitoring integrations performed by the integrator.

1. Click **Store Name, Category and Integrator ID** and in the **Store Name** field enter the name that should be displayed on the buyer's invoice.
2. Under **Category of your store**, set the category of the products that are sold, for example, "Cell Phones and Accessories".
3. Under **Integrator ID**, enter your _integrator_id_ so that it is possible to register how many sales were processed with your account. If you don't have one, leave the field blank.
