# What are the Payment Links and Buttons?

The payment links and buttons are quick and practical payment solutions that allow you to sell online without the need for technical or programming knowledge.

If you have a website, you can simply insert an HTML code that will show a **payment button** on your page.
If you don't have a website, the **payment link** will help you to charge online using very simple steps.

## How does it work?
 - From your Mercado Pago account, access the [Payment Link and Button](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]) and select the Create New option.
 - Set the title and price of your product or service. You can also add a photo.
 - Choose where you want to sell: social networks, email or website and you're done!

> It is not necessary for your customer to have a Mercado Pago account in order to make the payment!
