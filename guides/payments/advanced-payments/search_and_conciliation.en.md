# Search and Reconciliation

An important part of the generation of payments is the reconciliation. The API allows you to search your `advanced payments` in order to reconcile all the transactions that were made through your Marketplace.

It is possible to search through the Advanced Payments API.

#### Filter search by date

Status                       |Expected Values ​​Example                                                                               |
-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
range                        |**date_created**: Transaction creation date, **date_last_updated**: Transaction last update date      |
begin_date                   |2019-05-30T00:00:00.000**-04:00**                                                                     |
end_date                     |2019-05-30T23:59:59.000**-04:00**                                                                     | 
                                                                      
To filter a query by date you must use the combination of the three states, in the range field one must inform **one of the two possible options in bold**, the end_date field must always be more recent than begin_date, **timezone ** at the end must be preserved, the remainder is editable as follows: YEAR-MONTH-DAY "T" HOUR-MINUTE-SECOND-MILLESIMAL.


### Export Activities

There is also the possibility of exporting the activities from the list of your Mercado Pago account with the link `Export`.
