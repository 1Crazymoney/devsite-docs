# Build the store

In order for the Mercado Pago cartridge to work with your site, you must integrate it into the store in such a way that it maintains its functionality together with other cartridges that you may have installed. To achieve this, you will need to build the store by following these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt terminal and position yourself on the "int_mercadopago" folder.
2. Run the following commands:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

Done, you already have the cartridge code integrated into the store site.
