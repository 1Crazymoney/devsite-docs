# Test the integration

To verify that the store is configured correctly, we recommend that you make test purchases using Mercado Pago's [test cards](/developers/en/docs/salesforce-commerce-cloud/additional-content/test-cards).
To run a test, follow these steps:

## Credit card purchases

1. Follow your store's purchase flow.
1. On the payment page, select the **Credit Card** option.
1. Choose to pay with a new credit card and use the [test cards](/developers/en/docs/salesforce-commerce-cloud/additional-content/test-cards) to make the payment. **It is important not to pay with cards for personal use**.
1. Add the information of the indicated test card (card number, CVV and expiration date).
1. Click the **Pay** button.
1. At checkout, check with your store that the purchase is listed as "Approved."
