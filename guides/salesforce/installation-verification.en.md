# Verify the Mercado Pago installation

To ensure that the Mercado Pago payment processor is installed, follow these steps.

1. Within your Salesforce store, go to the **Merchant Tools** menu and click the **Payment Processors** option found within the Ordering group of options. You can also find the option using the menu search engine.
2. In the **Processor ID** column, confirm that the "MERCADOPAGO_PAYMENTS" option exists.

You don't need to do any additional configuration in this instance.
