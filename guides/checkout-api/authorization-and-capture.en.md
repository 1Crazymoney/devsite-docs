# Payment authorization and capture

Add specific features to your integration based on your business needs.

Offer the possibility of granting an authorization before payment capture. This allows you to make a fund reserve in your buyer's card without making a payment.

For example, to grant an authorization when you reserve a car, or for an estimated purchase price prior to confirmation.
