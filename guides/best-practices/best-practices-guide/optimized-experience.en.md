# General aspects of your checkout 

Learn about the main components of a checkout and how to optimize them to offer a better experience for your users and get more conversion.

## Segment your content

Use **headings** to group by theme the required details and indicate to the users in which section they are, and **subheadings** to give context or explain which action is expected. You can also add **explanatory texts** to detail a certain information, if necessary.

![en aspectos generales - segmenta tu contenido](/images/best-practices-guide/EngAspectosGeneralesSegmentaTuContenido.png)

The headings help scanning and the subheadings allow users to have more information, which makes them feel safer.

## Optimize your forms

**Forms** are sets of related inputs that have a common purpose (e.g: personal details). In turn, the **inputs** are fields where the users must fill and edit the required information. They should have a logical order within the form and the required ones should be differentiated from the optional ones. Additionally, they must be long enough so that users can view the information they have entered and easily review and edit them.

In order to make filling out the form easier and do not tire the user: 

* Use a few inputs per form.
* Remove any request of information that is not essential for the purchase process or that could be inferred from previous details.
* Do not be redundant and request each detail only once, whenever possible.

## Add elements to your inputs that guide the users: 

### Labels and placeholders

**Labels** are the names of each input and indicate which detail should be entered. They should be constantly visible so that users can scan and fill out the form faster, since they work as a guide and prevent users from having to remember what information they should enter. 

**Placeholders** are the filler texts of each input and exemplify or explain the information that should be entered. Take advantage of this step to put examples of format or actionables. When users place their mouse cursor on the input or fill the detail, the placeholder disappears. That is why you should avoid using placeholders as labels so that users do not have to make an effort to remember which detail they should enter in each input or have to clear the information entered in case they want to confirm it. 

Both the labels and the placeholders must be short, direct and clear to prevent users from making mistakes.

### Helpers and tooltips

**Helpers** are the explanatory texts that go below the inputs and allow providing additional information about what the detail is and why it is being requested. Use them to justify the request of sensitive details or give relevant information about the field.

In turn, the **tooltips** are notifications that offer an extra layer of information when the helper is not enough. Use them to add definitions, complementary information or actionables through links.

### Success and error messages

**Success and error messages** validate the information entered in the inputs. To add emphasis, it is possible to use the green color in the success messages and red in the error ones. 

Use success messages only if the confirmation is necessary or if the entered detail adds value to the user (e.g: free shipping or discount). In case of an error, it is important to make it clear what was the problem and provide a solution so that the user does not make the mistake again and gets frustrated. If the input has a helper, it should be replaced by the error message.

## Add clear actionables

**Call to action** (CTAs) allow performing the main and secondary actions of a page and can be applied in different styles (buttons, icons or links) according to its hierarchy, and in different places (cards, tooltips, etc.). Here are some tips:

* Use contrasting colors so that the CTAs can stand out and be differentiated from the page background. 
* Make sure they are clear and direct in order to provide context.
* Use buttons for the main actions and write them in the infinitive verb tense so that there is no ambiguity.
* Add links for secondary actions that add context and make sure it is a self explanatory text that makes reference to where the users are being redirected to.

The CTA must make it clear what the action is and what will happen when the user clicks on it.

## Offer options and highlight their benefits

Users have to choose between different options along the whole payment process (shipping methods, payment methods, number of installments, etc.) and conversion can vary depending on different factors and the context of each one.

That is why you should offer options that include the different possible variables and order them in descending order, taking into account the most used or beneficial for your clients. However, you should not offer an unlimited number of options, only the most common ones, otherwise you may confuse and hinder the selection process. 

You can use radio buttons when there are just a few options and users can select only one, dropdowns when there are several options and you do not want to use so much space in the screen. You can also use cards when there are visual options, among others. In addition, you can add the most important value propositions in each option to help users to have more information to make a decision.

## Skip the unnecessary steps

Avoid requesting repeated details, which can be inferred or are not necessary to complete the purchase. To do this, take advantage of the steps where required details are requested to get information you will need later.

For example, you can use the personal and shipping information to get the billing details and do not add an extra form that slows down the payment process.

![en Saltea pasos innecesarios](/images/best-practices-guide/EngAspectosGeneralesSalteaPasosInnecesarios.png)

Simplify and shorten the process of filling out the details with checkboxes that infer information from previous steps or display a form in case users want to enter different information.

## Give visibility during the process and allow users to review the purchase before confirming it

Even though most of the users review their purchase in the final step, they feel safer when they can control each action they are performing during the process. For that, you can add a fixed **summary component** or a shortcut to the shopping cart that shows the total price to be paid according to the actions being performed (e.g: discount coupon, shipping cost, etc). 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://http2.mlstatic.com/storage/dx-devsite/docs-assets/images/best-practices-guide/EngAspectosGeneralesVisibilidadDelProceso.gif?v=3.46.1-rc-6">
</p>

You can add a permanent summary component during the whole process that shows the performed actions with the total amount to be paid. This way users can always view and control the final price. 

Additionally, before completing the purchase, it allows your users to review the entire process and the final price. For this, add a **confirmation or review page**, before the payment.

On this page, include a summary of all the decisions made and information entered, as well as the total amount to be paid. It is important to give users the possibility to edit any of the details from there, without the need to go back to previous steps.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://http2.mlstatic.com/storage/dx-devsite/docs-assets/images/best-practices-guide/EngAspectosGeneralesConfirmaTuCompra.gif?v=3.46.1-rc-6">
</p>

Allowing the edition in a step previous to the purchase confirmation not only facilitates scanning the page, but also helps users to edit the incorrect details more easily and without the need to go back.
