# Transition states

In addition to handling conventional payment statuses, i.e., `pending`, `approved` or `rejected`, the Status Screen Brick also provides an additional experience for **pending payments** by `Challenge`, in the case of [3DS 2.0](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/how-tos/improve-payment-approval/3ds), or other cases that require redirection to external domains.

The integration process is the same as for the other states, with no additional configurations required. See [here](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/status-screen-brick/default-rendering) for more details on the integration process.
