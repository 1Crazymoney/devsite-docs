# Status Screen Brick 

The Status Screen Brick allows you to show the buyer the status of a purchase made with any payment method provided by Checkout Bricks. With this Brick it is possible to view the purchase summary, as well know the current payment status and view the details of payment tickets.

It is also possible to use it to handle payment processes that require redirects or additional confirmations, in the case of [3DS 2.0](/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/how-tos/improve-payment-approval/3ds).
