If you want to obtain the current order data of a POS, use the curl that you will find in our **API Reference** by accessing [Get order](/developers/en/reference/instore_orders_v2/_instore_qr_seller_collectors_user_id_pos_external_pos_id_orders/get), where you can also find detailed information about the request and response parameters.
