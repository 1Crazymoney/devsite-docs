## Obtain order data

If you want to obtain the current order data of a POS, use the curl that you will find in our **API Reference** by accessing [Get order](/developers/en/reference/instore_orders_v2/_instore_qr_seller_collectors_user_id_pos_external_pos_id_orders/get), where you can also find detailed information about the request and response parameters.

## Generate sales reports

Integrate the [Mercado Pago reconciliation reports](/developers/en/guides/additional-content/reports/general-considerations/reconciliation-reports) with your system to reconcile your sales and view your account movements.

## Test and validate your integration

We detailed all the necessary scenarios you should test to ensure your system's successful integration with Mercado Pago.
