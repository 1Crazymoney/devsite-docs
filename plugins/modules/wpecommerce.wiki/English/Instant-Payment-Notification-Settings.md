Instant Payment Notifications (IPN) is a mechanism that enables your store to receive messages from Mercado Pago server about the status of a given payment. In this plugin, you don't need to worry about IPN configuration as it is already implemented and configured for you.

> HINT 1: When configuring or testing your IPN/Webhooks and server communications be sure that your server can access Mercado Pago server.

> HINT 2: Make sure that your firewall haves [Mercado Pago IP Ranges](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/api-docs/basics/design-considerations#ip-range) within its white-list.

> HINT 3: Pay attention that Mercado Pago uses TSL protocol version 1.0, so your server needs to support/accept connections with this protocol version.

> HINT 4: Make sure that any other WordPress plugin can block Mercado Pago.
